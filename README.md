## Apollo Client with React

This is a basic React application integrating Apollo Client for communication with GitHub GraphQL API V4.

Before using it, make sure that you have replaced the token variable in `index.js` with you own API token for GitHub.

After cloning, run `npm install` to fetch the required modules and then `npm start` to initialize the local server.

Make sure you have __NodeJS__ installed on your computer.
